        <p>Litha Kane is a bornner of South African.
        <br>
        <br>
        
        Although I am only 21 years of age,
        <br>
        I feel as if 
        time is no longer on our side. 
                
        My family gets smaller 
        as the years pass. 
        <br>
        I no longer have any grandparents,
        and the rest of the family rarely talks or gets along.
        <br>
        I'm sure each reader thinks about how they really wish
        they appreciated their youth more, 
        <br>
        but we can't stop time; we can only cherish it.
                
        <br>
        <br>
            
        Tick tock...tick tock...
        <br>
        <br> 
        Life is counting down on your internal clock.
        
        Memories that feel as if they occurred yesterday
        <br> 
        turn to flashes of moments that seem to fade away.
        <br>
                People you once knew
        walk by without a clue.
        <br> 
        The times you once shared
        exist as if you were never there.
        <br> 
        Years fly...friends die...
        and you never know when you'll say your last goodbye.
        <br> 
        Oh, how I wish I could turn back time,
        spend it with loved ones and cherish what once was mine.
        
        Or to go back even more,
        being a kid in a candy store.
        <br> 
        How I miss the way I used to feel
        on Christmas day when Santa was real.
        
        But back to reality...back to today,
        family is scarce and memories continue to fade away.
