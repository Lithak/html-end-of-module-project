<b>You tarnished my soul , 
    <br>
    vanished the light in me , 
    <br>
    nourished the darkness within me , 
    <br>
    soul drenching , 
    <br>
    and heartbreaking , 
    <br>
    is that really what your good for ? 
    <br>
    You literally left me wondering how you could be capable of such , 
    <br>
    how you've perfected the art of lying so much . 
    <br>
    You tarnished my soul , 
    <br>
    ripped the bliss off my emotions,  
    <br>
    torn apart the essence of my devotions,    
    <br>
    chased away the prideful glim off my face.   
    <br>
    You figuratively left my emotions to wonder motionlessly 
    <br>
    in this dark yet versatile life , 
    <br>
    constantly stabbing me  with your words which 
    <br>
    penetrate my torso deeper than a knife. 
    <br>
    You tarnished My soul , 
    <br>
    Took away my ability to care, 
    <br>
    vanquished it till it became rare, 
    <br>
    made darkness and me seem like the perfect pair. 
    <br>
    You may tarnish me with your spiteful words, 
    <br> 
    but you'll never decipher who I truly am,  
    <br>
    you'll never make me vulnerable to your pathetic ways. </b>
