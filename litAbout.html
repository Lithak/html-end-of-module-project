                        <br><b>I'd strive for quality love.
                        <br>I'd start a war for  love. 
                        <br>I'd sing on top of the tallest mountain for love. 
                        <br>Only if I were to love. 
                        <br>
                        <br>If I were to fall for you in particular, 
                        <br>You'd be one lucky angel. 
                        <br>Love so sweet like honey, 
                        <br>You wouldn't wish I left your sight. 
                        <br>You'd be smiling all day just by the thought of me. 
                        <br>Love feels so right like destiny. �
                        <br>You wouldn't wish I stopped talking. 
                        <br>You'd be my one &amp; only. 
                        <br>Love turned out to be Marriage. 
                        <br>You wouldn't be alone forever. �
                        <br>
                        <br>Like seriously, 
                        <br>If I were to fall in love with you. 
                        <br>It would miss a day telling you
                        <br>You beautiful, I love you.�

                        <br>There's no guarantee you'd fall with me. 
                        <br>Let love be our wings to get us up. 
                        <br>Nah you wouldn't I can see it in your eyes. 
                        <br>They full of anger, 
                        <br>You've been taken for a fool before. 
                        <br>I wouldn't mind to heal the scars in your heart. �
                        <br>Wipe out the fear at the back of your head. 
                        <br>
                        <br>If I were to fall for you, 
                        <br>You'd be my princess without a crown. � 
                        <br>And I we were to fall for each other, 
                        <br>I'd be your God sent prince. </b>
